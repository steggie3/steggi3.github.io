There are a few algorithmic problems that deal with histograms. The histograms can sometimes be viewed as a set of "buildings" with different heights, making up a "skyline." 

1. Compute buildings with a sunset view [EPI 9.6]
2. Compute the largest rectangle under a skyline [EPI 18.8] [LeetCode 84]
3. Compute the skyline from a set of buildings [EPI 25.29] [LeetCode 218]
4. Compute maximum building height increase while keeping the skyline [LeetCode 807]
5. Trapping Rain Water (1-D) [EPI 18.7] [LeetCode 42]
6. Trapping Rain Water (2-D) [LeetCode 407]
