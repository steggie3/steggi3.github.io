ResNet is proposed in the 2015 paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385){:target="_blank"} to resolve the problem of the increasing difficulty to optimize for the parameters in deeper neural networks. By introducing identity shortcut connections in the network architecture, the network depth can easily reach 152 layers and still remain easy to solve. As a comparison, [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556){:target="_blank"}, a previous state-of-the-art network proposed in 2014, has only 16 layers. It is widely recognized that the increased depths in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely helpful in computer vision tasks. From the input to the output, each layer of the network is essentially performing low to high-level feature extraction. By adding more layers, more fine-grained levels of features can be recognized and processed. As a result, ResNet won many computer vision competitions in 2015 and is proved to be extremely powerful.
