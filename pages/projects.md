## [Object Detection with Goose Dataset](/projects/goose-detection.html)
[Python/Tensorflow]
Using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to mark the locations of goose faces in images. I'm an amateur photographer and I love Canada geese, so I made a [Goose Dataset](https://github.com/steggie3/goose-dataset) with my own photos and experimented on it.

## The GANder Project
[Python/Keras]
Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate goose faces based on the Goose Dataset. The geese are not necessarily ganders (male geese) but the name fits.

## [Loan Default Prediction](/projects/loan-default.html)
[Python/Keras]
Applying machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forests, gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost), SVM, nearest neighbors, and neural networks to predict the loan default probability. Also experimented with feature engineering techniques such as feature hasing, discretization, principal component analysis (PCA), etc.

## F-RankClass
[C++/MATLAB]
Joint text-image document classification and mining on Wikipedia entries. This is a class project for CS512 Data Mining Principles at UIUC and has also been published at International Conference on Data Mining. 

## Algorithmic Stock Trading
[C++/MATLAB/Tensorflow]
Using SVM and neural networks to predict buy/sell events.

## Social Network Graph Partitioning
[C++]
Taking advantage of social network properties, performing hierarchicasl graph partitioning to make each subgraph feasible in size. This is a class project for ECE598YL Cloud Computing at UIUC.

## Compact Modeling and Simulation of Emerging Transistors and Circuits
[C++/MATLAB]
Developing physics-based compact models of the newly proposed graphene nanoribbon transistors and transition metal dichalcogenide transistors. Released 3 open-source transistor models on nanohub.org (an open-source platform for nanotechnology research). This is my Ph.D. disseration at UIUC.

## Clock Tree Synthesis
[C++]
Clock tree synthesis focusing on robust skew and slew control via delay and slew modeling, with exploration of buffer insertion and buffer sizing in clock trees. This is my M.S. thesis at UIUC.

## Numerical Circuit Simulator
[C++]
Implementing a SPICE-like numerical circuit simulator based on matrix representation of circuits, including DC, AC, and transient analysis. This is a class project for ECE552 Numerical Circuit Analysis at UIUC.

## EDA Backend Design Flow
[C++]
Implementing the EDA backend design flow including partitioning, placement, routing, and timing analysis. This is a class project for ECE582 Physical VLSI Design at UIUC.

## EDA High-Level Synthesis Optimization
[C++]
Developing and implementing a high-level circuit synthesis framework on optimization of concurrent resource binding, task scheduling, and logic cell placement by integer-linear-programming formulation. This is a class project for ECE527 System-on-Chip Design at UIUC.

## Comparative Study of Multi-Gate Transistor Designs
[MATLAB]
Survey, comparision, and simulation of multi-gate transistors including FinFET. This is a class project for ECE585 MOS Device Modeling and Design at UIUC.
