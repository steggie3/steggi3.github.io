I am a software developer seeking full-time **software engineering** positions on **machine-learning** and/or **data science**. I had mostly worked in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) area, which is to develop scalable algorithms to solve problems encountered in all aspects of Integrated Circuit (IC) design, but I have always kept an interest in data science and machine learning and have worked on related projects in my spare time. Now, I am aiming to advance my career in the machine-learning and data science area.

I worked at Synopsys Inc. as an R&D engineer from 2015 to 2018 in the ZeBu Compile Team, where I gained invaluable software engineering skills. Synopsys is a leader in the EDA industry, ZeBu is their rising emulation product, and the Compile Team worked on the development, enhancement, and maintenance of the Verilog/SystemVerlog/VHDL mixed-language compile and synthesis in the ZeBu emulation flow. I mainly worked in C++ on optimization and transformation of circuit computation graphs, and also on building an automatic testing and verification flow for internal use.

I went to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) for graduate school. I worked on compact modeling and simulation of emerging devices for my Ph.D. dissertation and on clock tree synthesis for my M.S. thesis. I also took some interesting classes and worked on projects such as F-RankClass (multimodal text-image joint classification and mining) and social network partitioning. My work is published in world-renowned journals and conferences such as Design Automation Conference (DAC) and International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM). I worked as a teaching assistant for classes such as System-on-Chip Design, Digital Systems Laboratory, and Microcomputer Laboratry, where I developed a few lab materials and held guest lectures. I also worked at Intel's Strategic CAD Labs as a research intern on timing variation modeling and optimizations. All these projects and experiences helped me build soild fundamentals in algorithms, data modeling, data science, and also strong analytical and communication skills.

I completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. My college research projects focused in EDA and in speech processing. I went to Taipei First Girls' Senior High School and was a prominent member of the Information Study Club, where I was appointed as the academic officer and held introductory classes to C++ programming for junior members.
