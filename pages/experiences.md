## Work Experience
- R&D Engineer (Software), Sr. II, Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA (November 2015 - February 2018)
    Worked on a mixed-language (SystemVerilog/VHDL) compiler for the ZeBu emulation system, including: 
    - Optimization and transformation on computation graphs and circuit data structures, achieving 27% running time improvement, 11% peak memory usage reduction, 35% emulation resource reduction. (C++)
    - Automatic test environment generation for time-series simulation and formal verification, creating a seamless testing and debugging framework, greatly accelerating the work flow for R&D and application engineers. (C++/Tcl)
- Research Intern (Software), Strategic Computer-Aided Design Labs, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR (August 2011 - December 2011)
    - Investigated process variation under near-threshold voltage circuit operations.
    - Performed numerical simulation and mathematical analysis of the most probable point theory. (C++/MATLAB)
    - Performed experiments on discrete gate-sizing optimization. (Perl/Tcl)
