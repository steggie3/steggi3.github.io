The 2016 paper [Personal Recommendation Using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks in NetEase](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~zhangdongxiang/papers/ICDE16_industry_231.pdf){:target="_blank"} proposes a session-based recommender system for e-commerce based on a deep neural network combining a feed-forward neural network (FNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The FNN part represents a historical-data-based collaborative filtering, and the RNN part captures the user's purchase intent from the webpage visit sequence in the current session.
