The Goose Dataset is [released on GitHub](https://github.com/steggie3/goose-dataset){:target="_blank"}. In addition to the images and annotations, I also implemented some APIs that allow people to load the data similar to how they do with Keras built-in datasets. I hope this will make this dataset more compatible with many implementations that were tested on Keras datasets.
